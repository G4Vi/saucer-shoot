//Saucer Shoot Extension Information:

Local coop mode added. Press 'c' to play coop
instead of pressing 'p' at start. 

Coop mode features the ability for two players
to play on the same computer. 

Player1 sports a blue ship with blue bullets and uses UPARROW and DOWNARROW to move
and the mouse with reticle to shoot.
Player2 sports a magenta ship with magenta bullets and 
uses 'W' and 'S' to move and 'D' to shoot (player2 only shoots in a straight line). 

Given that this a two dimensional solar system, ships cannot cross each other,
though once one of the players have died, the other can move freely. 

Additional coop features:
-twice as many starting saucers (32)
-twice as many nukes, conviently available on the spacebar ready for either player to use.

//Code implemented
SSManager now exists in order to keep track of game state and to dispatch input.
SSManager is variation of the singleton pattern, but operates a little differently.
It expects have it's static init function called before getInstance is called
as the Hero pointers must be set before getInstance could get anything useful.
In order to avoid memory leaks when using init wrong, it does not init if the
static instance pointer is not false. Additionally the getInstance returns NULL
if it has not been init. 

Game states kept track of:
Hero pointers, and nukes.

All keyboard and mouse is dispatched in SSManager to avoid handing the same
key in multiple places, so the Hero classes were changed to be "friends"
of SSManager in order to allow it to call their private methods. 

HeroBase created in order to cover the functions all the same in both Hero
classes Hero and Hero2. This includes moving, events, and some initilization and cleanup. 

Hero includes the reticle and firing to the mouse point. overrides Hero::fire(df::Vector target).
Hero2, just changes the sprite to the magenta ship and fire straight out the the ship. Overrides
Hero2::fire().
